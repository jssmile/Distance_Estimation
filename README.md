# Distance_Estimation
***
It's a opencv 3.2.0 project using python 2.7!  

My main goal is to estimate the distance from object(vehicles) to ths monocular camera.  

Before that, I do some practices and record it to purchase my goal.

## Folder Introduction 

### Base_implement
---
There are some simple implements for opencv

### caffe
---
It's a deeplearning library. I use it for object detection and recognizing. Single shot multibox detector is the most popular implement for computer vision.

### calibrate
---
It's a calibrate example and where to store the output. This code can generate out intrinsic and extrinsic parameter of the camera.

### car capture
---
It's the implement for detecting cars with haar-feature.
